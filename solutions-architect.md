## **Professional Experience**

### **Solutions Architect / Product Owner - AI Acceleration Platform**
**Dell Technologies** | Round Rock, TX | *2021 – Present*

*Architect and Technical Advisor for Dell’s internal AI platforms. Acted as the "CTO" for internal enterprise customers, guiding adoption from Beta to 60,000+ users.*

**Enterprise Search & Glean Deployment**
* **Glean Implementation:** Architected the technical solutioning and security integration for a major **AWS hybrid-cloud deployment of Glean** (Sales Chat). Successfully resolved complex networking, firewall, and IAM role-mapping challenges to integrate Glean into Dell’s restrictive enterprise environment.
* **RAG Platform Architecture:** Designed and built **"AskDell"**, an internal competitor/analogue to Glean. Gained intimate knowledge of the challenges customers face when indexing enterprise data (SharePoint, Confluence, ServiceNow) and managing semantic relevance.
* **Intent-to-Agent Routing:** Engineered a high-throughput routing engine handling millions of sessions. Reduced "incorrect agent" transfers by **40%**, demonstrating deep experience in the "Agentic" capabilities Glean is now pivoting toward.

**Customer Advisory & Post-Sales Success**
* **Scale & Adoption:** Guided internal business units through the architecture and design of AI integration, scaling platform adoption to **350%+ QoQ growth** and delivering **$100M+ in business value**.
* **Technical Enablement:** Created the "Day-One Dev Setup" and authored 150+ technical documents to help customer teams integrate with the platform. Led "Deep Dive" workshops on GenAI literacy, directly enabling non-technical stakeholders to leverage complex tools.
* **Strategic Partnerships:** Served as the primary technical liaison for high-stakes alliances with **VMware and NVIDIA**, aligning technical roadmaps with customer business goals.

**Infrastructure, Security & Reliability**
* **High Availability Engineering:** Maintained **100% uptime** during critical business events (Black Friday) via automated scaling policies and load testing.
* **Security Architecture:** Implemented RBAC for Tool-Use and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, ensuring strict adherence to enterprise security audits—a critical requirement for Glean’s financial/enterprise clients.
* **Observability:** Migrated reactive alerting to proactive AIOps (Prometheus/Splunk), reducing support tickets per user by 75%.

### **Sr. Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer**
**Dell Technologies** | Round Rock, TX | *2018 – 2021*

*Founding member of the Data Science practice; established core MLOps standards and CI/CD pipelines.*

* **Pipeline Automation:** Built end-to-end CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps/GitLab) including automated security scanning and secrets management, streamlining the "onboarding" of new models for internal customers.
* **Drift Detection:** Engineered automated test harnesses to detect data drift (PSI/KS tests), creating self-healing loops that ensured long-term reliability of deployed solutions.

### **Post-Doctoral Data Scientist**
**University of Texas at Austin** | Austin, TX | *2017 – 2018*

*Lead engineer for large-scale data ingestion pipelines, transforming unstructured data into structured knowledge.*

* **Unstructured Data Ingestion:** Engineered parallelized pipelines to ingest and parse **100M+ heterogeneous XML records**, managing the exact type of "messy enterprise data" Glean connects to.
* **Natural Language Processing:** Developed Topic Modeling pipelines to transform 20 years of unstructured text into structured **Knowledge Graphs**, mapping relationships between entities and organizations.

### **Ph.D. Researcher (Computational Sociology)**
**University of Texas at Austin** | Austin, TX | *2014 – 2017*
